This week we had two lectures and it was also the beginning of the project. So we created differents teams and created a schedule and organization for our group and which methodology

# **Day by day**
*Monday*
- This day we estimated every tasks and started to work on it. This week I'll be working on the architecture of the mobile application. We choose to use mvvm structure.

*Tuesday*
- I did some research on Kotlin and android studio too. I haven't use it in a while. Kotlin is a very complexe language, I have to understand a bit more before starting to code. So I watched differents tuto and I read lot of articles

*Wednesday*
- Today was difficult honnestly. I was implementing the mvvm structure in the projetc. But I had a lot of problems coming from Kotlin and dependencies version. I had to find the good version of each dependencies according to the language version. But the tutorial we were following seems to be deprecated. I also had trouble with corrupted files and needed to reinstall everything from scratch several times. Hopefully Filip was able to help me !

*Thursday*
- This morning I started working with some new tutorials and tried to do everything from scratch with the latest version of everything.
We also had the retrospective, where everyone presented its own tasks and do some demo. Then Filip told me that he was able to fix the dependencies ! :)
