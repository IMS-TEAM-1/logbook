# **Day by day**
*Monday*
- This day we estimated every tasks and started to work on it. We are still on the bluetooth. We have some problem with android permission. We are not able to make it work correctly. Everytime we start the app there is multiple errors.

*Tuesday*
- Today I tried to find a way to implement the bluetooth with the mvvm structure. Even if it's not working yet, I think its a good idea to think about it

*Wednesday*
- Today I didn't work on this project.

*Thursday*
- Today we had the retrospective.
