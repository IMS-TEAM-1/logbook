- This day we estimated every tasks and started to work on it. I have to continue to implemente the mvvm architecture on the mobile application. I also added the first fragment and linked it to the mainActivity. In this way, we will be able to display the layout and update the data. Now I have to go further in the architecture and apply it to an example to be sure that everything work together.
