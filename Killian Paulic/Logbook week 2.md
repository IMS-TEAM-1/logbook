*Monday*
- This day we estimated every tasks and started to work on it. I have to continue to implemente the mvvm architecture on the mobile application. I also added the first fragment and linked it to the mainActivity. In this way, we will be able to display the layout and update the data. Now I have to go further in the architecture and apply it to an example to be sure that everything work together.

*Tuesday*
- Today I worked again on the same topic. I implemented all the mvvm structure and I did an abtraction of the Http client and Api call to protect the access. I also created a part to handle the response of every call and serialize the data from Json to object automaticaly. In this way it will be very easy to deal with the incoming data!
These things are working perfectly and now I understand a bit more the structure and the mobile developement. To finish this part, I should adapt what Filip did whith his mocked api call, everything with dependencie injection (DI) to add every next steps of the project.
