# **Day by day**
*Monday*
- This day we estimated every tasks and started to work on it. I will try to take a look on the bluetooth part, I have no idea about how to implement this in an android project, even more with a good architecture!

*Tuesday*
- Today I didn't work on this project.

*Wednesday*
- On Wednesday, we worked on the merge between the mvvm architecture and the differents design like the home page with some data about the mower. So we had adapt what has be done, then we had some problems with dependencies version and how to fix the navigation bar. Finally, we did it. Then, we connected every tab with a dumb page to do the mocked api call that we did before. And to prepare the next steps, we created a modelView linked to the home page to be able to "start" the mower, even if it's a mocked api call, at least when we click on the button, we are sure that everything is working fine. 

*Thursday*
- Today we had the retrospective and I didn't work more on this project
