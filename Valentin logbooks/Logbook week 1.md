# **Summary**
This week we had two lectures and a meeting with the group to know each other and decided who would have which roles, made a preliminary schedule for meetings and planned the first week's sprint.

# **Day by day**
*Monday*
- This day I had our first lecture that explained what the project is. We were assigned groups and we created a discord channel that we use for our communication.

*Tuesday*
- Nothing happened that day.

*Wednesday*
- This day I had another lecture where guest lecturers from Husqvarna told about how their organization is structured and how they work within the company.

*Thursday*
- This day the group met at 13:00 and we introduced ourselves and got to know other group members. We started the meeting by discussing how we would divide and who would do which parts. We divided the group into two smaller groups, built-in systems and back-end / application. Each group received a Scrum master and I became Team leader. With this structure, Scrum masters will hold stand-up meetings with their respective groups and then 1 day a week I will have a meeting with Scrum masters as we go through how the week has gone and plan next week's tasks.
- We have also planned the first week's sprint together so that everyone in the group could come up with suggestions on what they thought would be needed for us to have a good start to the project (Future plans will be made by Team leader and Scrum masters). The group has also made a preliminary schedule for what the weeks will look like in the future and when the various meetings will be so that everyone could be present at meetings.
- After we have decided how the group would work, we started working a bit on the project. Github organization and a Trello board was created.

*Friday*
- Nothing happened that day.
