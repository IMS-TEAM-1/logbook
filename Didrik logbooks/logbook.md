# week 1

v.27 2022

The groups first meeting was on thursday (31/3).

In the meeting we decided our group structure of two teams with a scrum master in each, along with a product owner / team leader.
I am the scrum master for the backend-mobile team, and John is the scrum master for the mower team.

We split into teams and started to work on the database structure. We have a good idea of how it should look, but some questions remain regarding what areas of communication are done via the api or bluetooth to the mower. We can therefore not finalize our database structure.

A schedule was also set, where we meet on mondays at 9:00 to do a sprint planning session with the whole group.
We have internal team standups at tuesdays and wednesdays, and a demo at thursdays where the whole group is present.

Some tasks / stories where created in Trello but they need refinement.

# week 2

## sprint planning 04042022

We al met at school for the first sprint planning session. Because a lot of discussion about what needs to be done was happening last week we all had a rough idea of what we needed to start working on. We played planning poker to assign point to tasks to see how difficult we percieved them to be. After that we split into smaller groups, two or three for each task, and started working on them. My team made som progress on the backend architecture and structure, what packages to use etc.


# standup 05042022

Standup meeting online. Everyone has progressed well with the task and we are on time schedule for this week. No hiccups.
