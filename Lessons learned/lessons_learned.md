## Bullet points

- Change hardware from old to new if available, as it is way faster and saves time :) (Rasberry Pi 0W to Rasberry Pi 4)

- Decide on a set meeting time and do not change it.

- While meetings on site are often better structured, the travel time to and from can be cumbersome for some. We decided to keep only the retrospective on sight.

- Decide on rules on how to handle people not present.
We never decided on any rules for it, but feel like it would be good to have some set ways of handling it.

- Come better prepared for integration tests.
There where many instances where we where supposed to have an integration test but could not because of bad preparation or small bugs.

- Focus on the task at hand.
There was talk about starting implementation of bluetooth already in week 4, but due to inproper task focus it got delayed until the last week.


## Main takeaways

`System wide tests`

More system wide tests that are better planned, and people are more prepared for them.
This is important to make sure that all new features introduced in a sprint works as intended.


`Work breakdown structure`

We decided to plan our project with a Trello board and use tickets for every sprint.
We feel like it would be a good idea to have a deeper planning session in the beginning and create a proper work breakdown structure to get an overview of the whole timeline for the project.
We did also stop using Trello and our Mira board in the end of the project, instead relied on communication between teams.
While this worked okay, it was not documented.
